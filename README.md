# Tic-Tac-Toe
Our project name is Tic-Tac-Toe. This game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two player game. In this game, there is a board with n x n matrix. In our game, it is 3 x 3 matrixes. The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid.
